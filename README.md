# Project-Uploader
This code creates a web application for submitting and managing projects. Users can submit project details through a form, including the project name, website, tags, and comments. The backend uses Node.js and Express.js to handle submissions, storing the data in a MongoDB database. It also allows users to download all projects as a JSON file
